ðŸš€ Deep Learning Project: Hierarchical Video Vision Transformer with Bidirectional LSTM

This repository houses the code for a cutting-edge deep learning project that combines the power of Bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) with a custom Hierarchical Video Vision Transformer layer. The project focuses on enhancing video analysis tasks by leveraging advanced techniques from both sequence modeling and vision transformers.

Key Features:

Bidirectional LSTM: Captures temporal dependencies in videos by analyzing sequences bidirectionally.
Hierarchical Video Vision Transformer: Applies transformer-based attention mechanisms to video frames, accounting for both spatial and temporal information.
Advanced Deep Learning: Harnesses the capabilities of both LSTM and Vision Transformers for improved video understanding.
State-of-the-Art: Integrates recent advancements in deep learning architectures for tackling complex video analysis tasks.
Modular and Extensible: Clean code structure for easy understanding, experimentation, and extension.
